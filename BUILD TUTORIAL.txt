USING MinGW

1 - Download Qt OffLine Installer for Windows MinGW: http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2
 
2 - Download VST SDK: http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

3 - Run Qt installer and check the options below: 
	Qt -> Qt 5.5 -> MinGW 4.9.2 32 bit
	Qt -> Tools -> MinGW 4.9.2
	This will install Qt compiled with MinGW and install MinGW tools (compiler, debugger, etc) in [Qt install folder]/Tools. 

4 - Open QtCreator (the Qt IDE). QtCreator is located in[Qt install folder]/Tools/QtCreator.exe. If you select Tools->MinGW in setp 3 QtCreator is configured to use MinGW, this is the easy way!

5 - Open the Jamtaba.pro file in QtCreator


6 - In QtCreator project tree (left side) open the file Standalone.pro and change 

		VST_SDK_PATH = "E:/Jamtaba2/VST3 SDK/"

to the correct VST SDK PATH in your hard disk.


7 - [Optional Step]: In QtCreator click in "Projects" in left side to open the "Build Settings" page. In "Build Steps" section expand you will see "qmake" and "Make" details. Open "Make" details (click in the combo in right side). Now you see a text field for "Make arguments". Put "-j 4" in this text field, where "4" is the number of cores in your processor. This will speed up the compilation using all your processor cores.

8 - Have fun! This is the most important step!
